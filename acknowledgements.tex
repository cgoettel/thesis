I would like to thank Professor Lunt for his continued motivation and faith in me to finish this work. He was instrumental in keeping me focused and on track. Additionally, his reviews were crucial to this paper coming together.

My good friend Ethan Christensen and his knowledge of statistics were essential in completing this work.

Thank you to my committee for agreeing to work with me through this process. I'm happy I was able to finish before you retired.

Finally, I'd like to thank my parents for helping me become the man that I am today and giving me a love of education. Thank you.

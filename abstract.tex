This research examines the possible correlations between a computing student's learning preference and their academic success, as well as their overall satisfaction with their major. It found that IT students who are more reflective in their learning preference tend to have higher grades in their major. Additionally, it found that student age and their parents' education level were significant players in their academic success. However, there were no correlations found between major satisfaction and academic performance.
